            "1.) The gravitational pull of a rotating body. The distance between the earth and the sun is 14.7 million km. While Uranus is in the same system as the Earth, they do not have the same distance (14.7 million km). At one time Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were known as the seven planets, but now we have a solid definition, Pluto the only planet that does not orbit the Earth. Uranus and Neptune are still visible to earth, while Uranus and Pluto are at a distance of 14.7 million km away. They share a common orbit. The satellites of Uranus and Neptune are very close to the center of the solar system and close to the center of the universe. Since the distance between the earth and the sun is 14.7 million km, it is almost impossible for the sun to be more than 4 or 5 light years away.\n",
